#Description

2. The Furnace Design and implement a control module to control power of a furnace in order to increase the productionâ€™s efficiency. The power (small, medium, high) will depend on the temperature inside the furnace (cold, cool, moderate, hot, very hot) and of the capacity of the furnace (small, medium, high)

##Description of the solution: ###Input Variables

X = Temperature
	L = {cold, cool, moderate, hot, very hot}
	U = {x | 0 <= x <= 1}
Y = Capacity
	L = {small, mediu, high}
	U = {y | 0 <= y <= 1}


###Output

Z = (the power)
L = {small, medium, high}

###Algorithm

Mamdami model
Defuzzification: LOM - Largest of maximum
