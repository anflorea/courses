  CSS3 and CSS2 isn't different in the sense that they are different languages- they're both languages for defining the look and feel of a page written in a markup language. With CSS3 there are a lot more features that allow you to control additional aspects/behaviors of elements on a page. A couple of the more commonly used features include:
  <ul>
  <li>New selectors. With CSS3 you can select attributes with some fancy symbols (mostly modeled after regex, I believe). There are also new pseudo -classes that allow you to select child/sibling elements (eg :nth-child(even) allows you to select only the even numbered elements, extremely useful for alternating row colors in a table)</li>
<li>Text Effects. Text-shadows and a handy new word-wrapping feature</li>
<li>Transforms & Animations. Exactly like it sounds. You can specify timer properties and keyframes to create animations entirely using CSS</li>

</ul>
  Of course there are a lot more features than what is listed above, but the idea is that CSS3 introduces a whole new set of features that increase what styling can do for a page.
